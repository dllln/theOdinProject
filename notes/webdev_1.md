# Growth Mindset

**Fixed Mindset (ME!!)** - Someone who believes that if they dont get something on the first go, then they never will. They believe that they are not smart enough to understand or complete the challenge.

**Growth Mindset (WHAT I WANT TO HAVE!!)**- Someone who believes they can get better and grow at anything if they put forth the effort and persistence.


**Focus on all the positive gains in learning how to program and not the pitfalls of not getting something right away. Programming is hard**




# How to beat Procrastination

#### The Pomodoro Technique
    The Pomodoro Technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused. The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until the timer goes off. If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes, start the 25 minutes of work over again. Once you’ve successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. When your break is over, repeat the 25 minutes of work and 5 minute break. After you’ve completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer 15-30 minute break.
